# E01a-Control-Structues

Let's start writing some Python code! This is the first set of exercises for MSCH-C220; they should give you the tools to build your first game.

In order to complete the exercise, you will need to do the following:

* Create an account on [github.com](https://github.com).
* Download and install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

This repository contains several files that you will need to alter to complete the assignment. The instructions for the exercise are on Canvas.

Comments in Python are marked by a # sign (for single-line comments) or three matching quotation marks (''' or """) if a comment requires more than one line. They should also appear in a different color in VS Code. The Python Interpreter ignores comments, so you can safely include any information you want there.

As with your assignments, please edit the LICENSE file (replace the [year] [fullname] with the current year and your name); you will also be expected to edit README.md to describe what you have accomplished.

Edit questions.txt to answer the questions found there.

If you want more detailed instructions, here are the steps to follow:

1. Log into your account on [github.com](github.com)
2. Go to the [exercise template page](https://github.com/BL-MSCH-C220-F19/E01a-Control-Structues) on GitHub
3. There is a button in the top right corner of the page labeled "Fork". Press that now
4. A modal window will appear asking you where you want to fork the repository. Select your account. This will create an independent copy of this repository in your account that you can begin to edit
5. Go to your GitHub home page, and select the new E01a-Control-Structures repository
6. On that page, you will see a green button labeled "Clone or download". Press that now. You will see a drop down box that contains the following: "Clone with HTTPS". Inside the dropdown, you will see a box containing an URL. Next to the box is an icon that looks like a clipboard with an arrow pointing to it. Click that icon now
7. Open VS Code. When the program opens, push the F1 key. In the box that opens, type "Git: Clone". Hit enter. In the box that then opens, paste the URL you copied from GitHub. Select a location for the repository; on Windows, the default is something like c:\Users\(username)\Documents\E01a-Control-Structures. VS Code will now clone (download) a copy of the code to your computer
8. VS Code should give you an opportunity to enter your username and password. If you see a dialogue asking if you want VS Code to check for changes periodically, you can select "No" 
9. Once VS Code has cloned (downloaded) the code, it will be responsible for keeping the code on your local computer synchronized with the repository in your GitHub account. In the panel to the left of the current window, you should see a list of the files you have downloaded

10. First, edit the file called LICENSE. Replace the [year] [fullname] with the current year and your name (e.g., 2019 Jason Francis). Save this file
11. Then answer the questions posed in questions.txt. You can edit that file directly; just leave your answers in the line after each question
12. When the time comes for you to run any of the python files, you can do so by right-clicking on the code and selecting "Run Python File in Terminal". The results will appear at the bottom
13. When you have answered all the questions, feel free to clean up this file. You can delete these detailed instructions. Then describe what you have accomplished. Save this file

---

14. When you are done editing the files, you should see an icon on the far-left bar that looks like three circles, connected by lines. That icon should be badged with a number representing the files you have changed. Push that button now
15. At the top of the leftmost area, you should see a text box labeled "Message". Add a message that describes what you have done; these messages are typically stated in the active-present tense. For example, "Updates the LICENSE, README.md, and completes the assignment." Click the check mark above the text box to commit your changes
16. In the drop down to the right of the check mark, select "Push"
17. Check out your page on GitHub. You should see the changes you made reflected there, Repeat steps 10 through 16 as necessary
18. When you are satisfied with your efforts, turn in a URL to your repository on Canvas

The grading criteria will be as follows:

* [1 point] Repository contains an appropriate software license
* [1 point] Repository contains a descriptive README.md
* [8] Accomplishes the objective of the exercise

10 points total

README DESCRIPTION
In this assignment I ran all of the python programs while answering the questions, changed the license in the licensce file, and commented on some of the extra credit program code lines but got confused about what they were saying.
